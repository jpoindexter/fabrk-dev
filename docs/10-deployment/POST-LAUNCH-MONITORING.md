## Monitoring Philosophy

**Good monitoring enables:**
- Early detection of issues before customers complain
- Data-driven decision making
- Understanding user behavior and pain points
- Measuring success of features and campaigns
- Maintaining 99.9%+ uptime

**Three levels of monitoring:**
1. **Technical** - Server health, errors, performance
2. **Product** - User engagement, conversions, retention
3. **Business** - Revenue, churn, customer acquisition cost

---

## Key Metrics to Track

### Application Health

**1. Uptime**
- Target: 99.9% (8.76 hours downtime/year max)
- Monitor: Every 5 minutes
- Alert: Immediately on downtime

## Uptime Monitoring

### Option 1: UptimeRobot (Free)

**Setup:**
1. Go to [uptimerobot.com](https://uptimerobot.com/)
2. Create free account
3. Add HTTP(s) monitor for `https://fabrk.dev`
4. Set check interval: 5 minutes
5. Add alert contacts (email, SMS, Slack)

**Monitors to create:**
- Landing page: `https://fabrk.dev`
- API health: `https://fabrk.dev/api/health` (create this endpoint)
- Stripe checkout: `https://fabrk.dev/api/stripe/checkout` (GET request should return 405)

### Option 2: Better Uptime (Paid, $10/mo)

Better features:
- Status page (status.fabrk.dev)
- Incident management
- On-call scheduling
- Phone call alerts

### API Health Endpoint

Create `src/app/api/health/route.ts`:

```typescript
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { prisma } from "@/lib/prisma";

export async function GET() {
  try {
    // Check database connection
    await prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT 1`;

    return NextResponse.json({
      status: "ok",
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      database: "connected",
    });
  } catch (error) {
    return NextResponse.json(
      {
        status: "error",
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
        database: "disconnected",
      },
      { status: 503 }
    );
  }
}
```

Monitor this endpoint with UptimeRobot. It checks both app and database health.

---

## Error Tracking

### Option 1: Sentry (Recommended)

**Setup:**

```bash
npm install @sentry/nextjs
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i nextjs
```

**Configure `sentry.client.config.ts`:**

```typescript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN,
  tracesSampleRate: 0.1, // 10% of transactions for performance monitoring
  environment: process.env.NODE_ENV,
  enabled: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production",
});
```

**What Sentry tracks:**
- JavaScript errors
- API errors
- Performance issues
- User sessions (when errors occur)
- Release tracking

**Set up alerts:**
- New error type appears
- Error rate >10/hour
- Critical errors (payment failures, auth issues)

### Option 2: LogSnag (Lightweight Alternative)

Simple logging for key events:

```bash
npm install logsnag
```

```typescript
// src/lib/logger.ts
import { LogSnag } from "logsnag";

const logsnag = new LogSnag({
  token: process.env.LOGSNAG_TOKEN!,
  project: "fabrk",
});

export async function logEvent(
  channel: string,
  event: string,
  description: string,
  notify: boolean = false
) {
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
    await logsnag.publish({
      channel,
      event,
      description,
      icon: "🚀",
      notify,
    });
  }
}
```

**Usage:**

```typescript
// Log new purchase
await logEvent("sales", "New Purchase", "John Doe bought Professional plan", true);

// Log errors
await logEvent("errors", "Stripe Webhook Failed", error.message, true);
```

---

## Performance Monitoring

### 1. Vercel Analytics (Built-in)

Monitor:
- Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Page load time
- Function execution time

**Set up Vercel Speed Insights:**

```bash
npm install @vercel/speed-insights
```

```tsx
// In src/app/layout.tsx
import { SpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights/next";

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        {children}
        <SpeedInsights />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### 2. Lighthouse CI (Automated Testing)

Run Lighthouse on every deployment:

```bash
npm install -g @lhci/cli
```

**Create `lighthouserc.json`:**

```json
{
  "ci": {
    "collect": {
      "url": ["https://fabrk.dev", "https://fabrk.dev/variations"]
    },
    "assert": {
      "assertions": {
        "categories:performance": ["error", { "minScore": 0.9 }],
        "categories:accessibility": ["error", { "minScore": 0.9 }],
        "categories:seo": ["error", { "minScore": 0.9 }]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Run weekly:

```bash
lhci autorun
```

### 3. Database Performance

**Monitor slow queries in Prisma:**

```typescript
// src/lib/prisma.ts
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

const prisma = new PrismaClient({
  log:
    process.env.NODE_ENV === "development"
      ? ["query", "error", "warn"]
      : ["error"],
});

export { prisma };
```

**Check query performance:**
- Prisma Studio → Query history
- Database provider dashboard (Vercel Postgres, Supabase, etc.)

**Alert if:**
- Query time >500ms (P95)
- N+1 query pattern detected
- Connection pool >80% usage

---

## Security Monitoring

### 1. Failed Login Attempts

Track failed auth attempts to detect brute force:

```typescript
// In src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
import { logEvent } from "@/lib/logger";

// Log failed sign-ins
async authorize(credentials) {
  const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
    where: { email: credentials.email },
  });

  if (!user || !bcrypt.compareSync(credentials.password, user.password)) {
    await logEvent(
      "security",
      "Failed Login Attempt",
      `Email: ${credentials.email}`,
      false
    );
    return null;
  }

  return user;
}
```

**Alert if:**
- >10 failed attempts from same IP in 5 minutes
- >100 failed attempts globally per hour

### 2. Stripe Fraud Detection

Monitor:
- Disputes/chargebacks
- Failed payments (might be stolen cards)
- High-value orders from new accounts

**Enable Stripe Radar:**
- Stripe Dashboard → Radar → Enable
- Blocks fraudulent payments automatically

### 3. Rate Limiting

Monitor API rate limit hits:

```typescript
// src/middleware.ts or rate limit middleware
import { logEvent } from "@/lib/logger";

if (rateLimitExceeded) {
  await logEvent(
    "security",
    "Rate Limit Exceeded",
    `IP: ${ip}, Endpoint: ${endpoint}`,
    false
  );
  return new Response("Too Many Requests", { status: 429 });
}
```

## Final Thoughts

**Good monitoring prevents disasters.** The goal is to:
1. Detect issues before customers complain
2. Respond quickly when issues occur
3. Learn from incidents to prevent recurrence
4. Make data-driven decisions about product and marketing

**Start simple.** Don't over-engineer monitoring on day 1. Core essentials:
- Uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot)
- Analytics (Plausible)
- Error tracking (Sentry)
