**Critical Blocker:** Test pass rate must reach 95%+ before launch. This is the only item preventing immediate release.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can we launch before fixing test pass rate?**
A: Technically yes, but not recommended. Tests prevent production incidents. Target: 95%+ by end of week 1.

**Q: What if payment processing fails on launch day?**
A: Have a rollback plan. See LAUNCH-CHECKLIST.md "Rollback Plan" section.

**Q: How do we distribute the boilerplate to customers?**
A: Via GitHub private repository. See DISTRIBUTION-SETUP.md for complete setup.

**Q: What's included in the launch?**
A: Full source code, 87 components, complete documentation, 72 test files, all examples.

**Q: Can customers extend/customize?**
A: Yes! Code is copy-paste friendly. Customers should customize, not extend.
