 *   delete:
 *     summary: Delete (detach) a payment method from customer
 *     description: |
 *       Detaches a payment method from the Stripe customer, effectively removing it
 *       from their saved payment methods. The payment method ID is still valid in Stripe
 *       but is no longer associated with this customer.
 *
 *       **Flow:**
 *       1. User clicks delete/trash icon on payment method
 *       2. Frontend confirms deletion with user
 *       3. Frontend calls this endpoint with payment method ID
 *       4. Server detaches payment method from customer
 *       5. Payment method is removed from customer's list
 *
 *       **Features:**
 *       - Validates payment method belongs to customer
 *       - Prevents deleting default payment method if it's the only one
 *       - Automatic cleanup in Stripe
